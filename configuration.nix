	# This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular machine,
	# and is used to maintain compatibility with application data (e.g. databases) created on older NixOS versions.
	#
	# Most users should NEVER change this value after the initial install, for any reason,
	# even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.
	#
	# This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,
	# so changing it will NOT upgrade your system - see https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-upgrading for how
	# to actually do that.
	#
	# This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
	# out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.
	#
	# Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
	# and migrated your data accordingly.
	#
	# For more information, see `man configuration.nix` or https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/options#opt-system.stateVersion .
